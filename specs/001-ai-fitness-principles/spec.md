l# Feature Specification: AI Fitness Application Principles

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-fitness-principles`  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create principles for an AI fitness application focused on real-time performance, accuracy over features, progressive enhancement, library-first architecture, test-driven development, and mobile-first responsive design with minimal dependencies."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Establish Core Principles (Priority: P1)

As a development team, we want to define guiding principles for the AI fitness application to ensure consistent development practices and high-quality outcomes.

**Why this priority**: P1 because principles provide the foundation for all development decisions and must be established first.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reviewing the documented principles against the specified focus areas and verifying they are accessible to the team.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the feature description specifies focus areas, **When** principles are defined, **Then** each focus area must have a corresponding principle.
2. **Given** principles are documented, **When** a developer references them, **Then** they provide clear guidance on real-time performance, accuracy, progressive enhancement, architecture, testing, design, and dependencies.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when principles conflict with each other? Resolution: Prioritize real-time performance and accuracy as core values, with others supporting them.
- How to handle evolution of principles over time? Principles should be reviewed quarterly and updated as needed.
- What if minimal dependencies limit functionality? Use progressive enhancement to provide core features without heavy dependencies.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST define a principle prioritizing real-time performance in all fitness tracking and AI operations.
- **FR-002**: System MUST establish accuracy over features as a core principle, ensuring reliable fitness data over extensive feature sets.
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement progressive enhancement, allowing core functionality to work without advanced features.
- **FR-004**: System MUST follow library-first architecture, building reusable components before application-specific features.
- **FR-005**: System MUST use test-driven development for all new code to ensure quality and reliability.
- **FR-006**: System MUST adopt mobile-first responsive design, optimizing for mobile devices before desktop.
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain minimal dependencies, using only essential libraries to reduce complexity and security risks.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Principle**: Represents a guiding rule with attributes: name, description, focus area, rationale.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All seven specified focus areas (real-time performance, accuracy, progressive enhancement, library-first architecture, test-driven development, mobile-first design, minimal dependencies) are covered by documented principles.
- **SC-002**: Principles are documented in a clear, accessible format and reviewed by at least 80% of the development team.
- **SC-003**: Principles guide at least 90% of architectural and development decisions in subsequent features.
- **SC-004**: Application maintains high performance metrics (response time < 100ms for real-time features) and accuracy rates (> 95% for fitness data).

## Assumptions

- Principles will be adopted by the entire development team.
- Focus areas represent the most critical aspects for the AI fitness application's success.
- Minimal dependencies will not prevent achieving core functionality through custom implementations.
