## 📦 Deliverables

### Core Libraries

#### 1. pose-analysis-3d Package
**MediaPipe Integration:**
- `PoseDetector` - Initializes MediaPipe Pose Heavy, processes video frames
- Returns 12 core body landmarks with 3D coordinates (x, y, z)
- Average confidence ≥0.9 for valid pose detection
- Proper error handling with custom `PoseAnalysisError` class

**Form Validation:**
- `FormValidator` base class with discipline-specific thresholds
- `PushUpsValidator` validates:
  - Elbow angle (min 90° bend during down phase)
  - Spine alignment (max 15° curvature)
  - Shoulder level (asymmetry < 5%)
  - Elbow flaring detection
- Returns `FormValidationResult` with score (0-100) and errors sorted by severity

**Rep Detection:**
- `RepDetector` with state machine (neutral → down → up)
- Detects complete rep cycles for push-ups
- Tracks peak metrics (minimum elbow angle achieved)
- Prevents false positives with proper state transitions

#### 2. coaching-engine Package
**Feedback Generation:**
- `FeedbackGenerator` creates corrective prompts from form errors
- 5-second deduplication window prevents message spam
- Prioritizes by severity (critical → high → normal → info)
- Maps error types to human-readable messages

**Voice Coaching:**
- `VoiceCoach` manages Web Speech API TTS
- Priority queue (max 3 items) with severity-based ordering
- Critical feedback always queued, never skipped
- Promise-based `speak()` method for async delivery

**Rep Counting:**
- `RepCounter` validates reps with minimum form score (50/100)
- Debouncing (500ms) prevents double-counting
- Tracks statistics: total reps, average form score, best rep
- Rejects low-quality reps automatically

#### 3. fitness-coach-app Package
**UI Components:**
- `CameraCapture` - getUserMedia integration with error handling
- `PoseOverlay` - Canvas 2D skeletal rendering at 30+ FPS
- `FeedbackDisplay` - Animated messages with Framer Motion
- `WorkoutControls` - Rep counter, timer, form score, pause/resume

**Web Worker Integration:**
- `pose-processor.ts` - Offloads MediaPipe to worker thread
- Handles INIT, PROCESS_FRAME, DISPOSE commands
- Transfers ImageData buffers for optimal performance
- `usePoseDetector` hook - Manages worker lifecycle and FPS tracking

**Pages:**
- Landing page with hero section and features
- Exercise selection page with push-ups card
- Live workout page with complete integration

**State Management:**
- Zustand `WorkoutStore` manages transient session state
- Actions: startSession, addRep, addFeedback, updateMetrics, endSession
- No persistence - data cleared on session end
