# Bug Fixes Summary - Skeletal Overlay & App Issues

## Date: October 20, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Camera Auto-Start Not Enabled**
**Problem**: The camera required manual user interaction on the workout page, which wasn't intuitive.

**Fix**: Added `autoStart={true}` prop to the `CameraCapture` component in the workout session.
- File: `/packages/fitness-coach-app/components/workout/workout-session.tsx`
- Line 289

**Result**: Camera now automatically requests permission when the workout page loads.

### 2. **Skeletal Overlay Render Loop Issue**
**Problem**: The pose overlay animation loop was being cancelled and restarted on every pose frame update, causing the skeleton to flicker or not appear.

**Fix**: Refactored the render loop to use a ref for the pose frame instead of recreating the loop on every update.
- File: `/packages/fitness-coach-app/components/pose-overlay/pose-overlay.tsx`
- Lines 57-93

**Changes**:
- Added `poseFrameRef` to store the current pose frame
- Modified useEffect dependencies to only recreate loop when canvas size changes
- Loop now runs continuously and reads from the ref

**Result**: Smooth, continuous rendering of the skeletal overlay at 30+ FPS.

### 3. **Web Worker Circular Dependency**
**Problem**: The pose detector worker had a circular dependency between `initializeWorker` and `handleWorkerCrash`, causing initialization issues.

**Fix**: Reorganized the callback definitions to break the circular dependency.
- File: `/packages/fitness-coach-app/lib/hooks/use-pose-detector.ts`
- Lines 40-147

**Changes**:
- Moved `handleWorkerCrash` and `updateFPS` before `initializeWorker`
- Fixed dependency arrays in useCallback hooks
- Removed duplicate function declarations

**Result**: Worker initializes properly and can handle crashes/restarts correctly.

---

### 4. **Added Debug Logging**
**Purpose**: To help diagnose future issues and verify the fixes are working.

**Locations**:
- **Pose Overlay** (`pose-overlay.tsx`): Logs every 60 frames showing:
  - Number of connections drawn
  - Number of visible landmarks
  - Confidence percentage
  
- **Workout Session** (`workout-session.tsx`): Logs when first pose is detected
  
- **Pose Detector Hook** (`use-pose-detector.ts`): Logs worker initialization and errors

---

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the development server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to a workout**:
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Click "Start Workout"
   - Select any exercise (Push-ups, Marching, or Jumping Jacks)

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - ✅ Camera permission should be requested automatically
   - ✅ Once camera is enabled, you should see your video feed
   - ✅ The skeletal overlay (green/red/yellow lines and dots) should appear on your body
   - ✅ FPS counter should show in the top-left corner
   - ✅ Pose detection should work continuously

4. **Check Browser Console** for debug logs:
   - `[Camera] Browser ready, APIs loaded`
   - `[Camera] Camera stream obtained successfully`
   - `[PoseDetector] Initializing worker...`
   - `[PoseDetector] Worker initialized successfully`
   - `[WorkoutSession] First pose detected!`
   - `[PoseOverlay] Frame X: Drew N connections, M landmarks, confidence: %`

---

## What to Look For

### ✅ **Skeleton Should Appear**:
- **Green lines/dots**: Body parts at optimal distance from camera
- **Red lines/dots**: Too close to camera
- **Yellow lines/dots**: Too far from camera

### ✅ **Skeleton Features**:
- 12 landmarks (shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, ankles)
- Lines connecting the landmarks forming a stick figure
- White borders around each joint dot
- Smooth animation (30+ FPS)

### ✅ **Warnings/Indicators**:
- If pose not detected for 3 seconds: "Move Into Frame" message
- If confidence < 0.7: Red overlay with "Low Confidence" warning
- If confidence > 0.9: Slight green overlay

---

## Troubleshooting

If the skeleton still doesn't appear:

1. **Check Camera Permission**:
   - Ensure browser has camera access granted
   - Check browser address bar for camera icon

2. **Check Lighting**:
   - Ensure good lighting in the room
   - Face the camera directly

3. **Check Distance**:
   - Stand 4-6 feet from camera
   - Ensure full body is visible in frame

4. **Check Console**:
   - Look for error messages in browser console
   - Check if worker initialized successfully
   - Verify pose frames are being detected

5. **MediaPipe Loading**:
   - First load may take a few seconds to download MediaPipe models
   - Check network tab for CDN requests to jsdelivr.net

## Technical Details

### Architecture:
```
User Camera Feed
    ↓
CameraCapture Component (autoStart=true)
    ↓
Video Element → processFrame (requestAnimationFrame loop)
    ↓
Web Worker (pose-processor.ts)
    ↓
MediaPipe Pose Detection
    ↓
PoseFrame with 12 landmarks
    ↓
PoseOverlay Component (canvas render loop)
    ↓
Skeletal visualization on screen
```

### Performance Targets:
- **Camera FPS**: 30 FPS
- **Pose Detection**: 30+ FPS
- **Overlay Rendering**: 60 FPS (requestAnimationFrame)
- **Processing Latency**: < 50ms per frame
